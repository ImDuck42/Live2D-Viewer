Planned:    
    - Local file editing
    - Update README screenshots


Maybe:
    - Support for "text": atributes on models
    - Status on what part of the model is loading (idk how guansss did it but idk if its possible in my version)
        - They on their own split loading different parts into their own functions and used those to print what function (model part) is currently running


Improve:
    - Support opening models from .zip files using jszip.js or sum - WORKING
        - A feature to load local zipped models via drop on the canvas or from the dropdown
        - Unavoidable stutters on model reselection if multiple are on the canvas due to base64 decoding
