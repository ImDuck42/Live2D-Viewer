Planned:
    - Support opening models from .zip files


Maybe:
    - Support for "text": atributes
    - Status on what part of the model is loading (idk how guanss did it but idk if its possible in my version)
    - Cutom look for title="" like tool tip
    - Custom cursor
    - Smoother animations


Other (No need for now):
    - Refactor all files 1st, 2nd, 3rd(css), 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th (major rework), 9th (major refactor), 


ISSUES:
    - Zooming on mobile devices wors once then on zoom just jumps all over the screen
    - const mm = selectedModel.internalModel?.motionManager; \n mm?.stopAllMotions?.(); breaks the motion button audio, tho the hit area and its button dosnt work without it

    DO THIS:
        - If the file fails to load for any reason, color the canvas border red for ten seconds
