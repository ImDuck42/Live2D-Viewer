Planned:
    - Support opening models from .zip files
    - Local file editing
    - If the file fails to load for any reason, color the canvas border red for ten seconds or sumtin


Maybe:
    - Support for "text": atributes on models
    - Status on what part of the model is loading (idk how guanss did it but idk if its possible in my version)


Other (No need for now):
    - Refactor all files 1st, 2nd, 3rd(css), 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th (major rework), 9th (major refactor),
