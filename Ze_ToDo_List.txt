Planned:
    - Support opening models from .zip files using jszip.js or sum
        - A somewhat working version to load local zipped models (very slow due to  hige strings):
        - https://imduck42.github.io/Live2D-Viewer/Archives_INACTIVE/tests/ziptouri.html
    
    - Local file editing
    - Update README screenshots


Maybe:
    - Support for "text": atributes on models
    - Status on what part of the model is loading (idk how guanss did it but idk if its possible in my version)
        - They on their own split loading different parts into their own functions and used those to print what function (model part) is currently running
