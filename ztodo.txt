Some Day:
    - Cutom look for title="" like tool tip
    - Custom cursor
    - Status on what part of the model is loading
    - Smoother animations
    - Custom drop down menu



Other (No need for now):
    - Refactor all files 1st, 2nd, 3rd(css), 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 

Fixed Issues:
    - general:
        - Model counter just goes up, number of models on canvas is correct but model id just grows
            - Was actually no issue, they just kept their id instead of going down by one on remove of another

Completed:
    - Destroy model with texture: true if last one of its kind
    - Thanks to 8con and Osaka for helping me
    - Preview content in explorer (tile as row, left/right)
        - verry different, still good
