maybe buttons glow as long as the motion lasts

update readme with feature of file explorer, nah redo entire md, hight of mobile imgs bit higher, maybe real mockups
update ipad size header, delete model button
on mobile if hitarea alreday selected/outlined and said area is tapped, itl glow pink instead of purple
hitareas toggle on activated, white outline
preview content in explorer tile as row, left/right


refactor all files 1st, 2nd, 3rd(css), 4th, 5th, 

known issues:
mobile: On mobile if website was in background, the hitboxes and selected model indicator stop working
general: if motion etc name is just big enough for 2, on click-scale up it gets to big and for press duration takees up one whale row
