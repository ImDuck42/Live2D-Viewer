Some Day:
    - Thanks to 8con and Osaka for helping me (put credits in the footer)
    - Maybe buttons glow as long as the motion lasts
    - Destroy model with texture: true if last one of its kind

Priority:
    - Preview content in explorer tile as row, left/right
    - Improve import model button in explorer
    - Cutom look for title="" like tool tip
    - Smoother animations
    - Search in repoexplorer when beginning to type

Other:
    - Refactor all files 1st, 2nd, 3rd(css), 4th, 5th, 6th, 

Known Issues:
    - general:
        - If motion etc name is just big enough for 2, on click-scale up it gets to big and for press duration takees up one whale row
        - Model counter just goes up, number of models on canvas is correct but model id just grows
